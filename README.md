# background-music
Enter your location, and The Background Music App will play some music to suit the weather and time of day of your whereabouts.

Three different APIs were combined in the building of the app. Geobytes was used to identify one's city using an autocompleting form. OpenWeatherMap helped with pulling weather information about a given city to be used for selecting music. Finally, the YouTube API enabled the embedding of a video player, looping a chosen track based on the information the app received.

The project was made for two reasons: a love of music, and practicing AJAX. I love video game soundtracks and the idea of having background music play based on what I'm up to. I was also studying front-end app development around the time I made the app, so the Background Music App was an exercise in making AJAX calls with different APIs and integrating them in a fun way.
